## features
###  Requirements
In this homework, the following four requirements need to be fulfilled: shading, fundamental transforms, 3D clipping, multiple objects and lights.
### a. Shading
Implement Flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading in shaders. Note that for Gouraud
shading, TAs have already written part of the Gouraud shading in the sample code. You can either
complete the remaining parts to finish Gouraud shading or write your own.
Figure 1: Flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading.
### b. Fundamental Transforms
Enable four fundamental transforms (translate, rotate, scale and shear) on
objects in a scene. You are free to use those provided model files and arrange them to form the
scene on your own style.
### c. 3D Clipping
Implement 3D clipping, at least in one direction(x or y or z).
### d. Multiple Objects and Lights
The scene should include at least three lights and three objects. Among the types of
objects, there should be at least two objects from different models. Additionally, the scene must
include three lights at different positions. You can verify the presence of the three lights through
the specular highlights in Phong shading.
### Bonus
not finish in hw1
### upcomeing Features
* more animation
* 3 axis clipping
* change light color and direction in realtime
